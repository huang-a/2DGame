Party system
4 people in the party
Once a person is dead, that person can't be replaced.
Each person in a party has a special skill(cook, mechanic, etc.)
If a person dies, certain tasks become harder but still possible 


Finalized story 
The start is on a boat in the Atlantic Ocean escaping, and there are 4 paths to choose from: east, west, north, south, and one direction leads to immediate death. The players don't know where they are, but it is obvious which one leads to death.
